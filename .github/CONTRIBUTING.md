# Contributing Guide

**Language**: [English](CONTRIBUTING.md) | [中文](CONTRIBUTING_CN.md)

> ⚠️ **Important**: Before starting to contribute, please read and configure the [**Pre-commit Guide**](PRE_COMMIT_GUIDE.md). Pre-commit automatically runs code checks and formatting on every `git commit` to ensure code quality and style consistency. This is an essential tool for maintaining code quality in the project, please complete the installation and configuration.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Backend Development

- Python 3.12
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Git

#### Frontend Development

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm package manager
- Git

### Clone Repository

```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FreeTodo.git
cd FreeTodo

# Add upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/FreeU-group/FreeTodo.git
```

### Configure Git Hooks (Pre-commit)

This repo uses a shared `.githooks/` directory. Run the setup script once per clone/worktree:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
bash scripts/setup_hooks_here.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/setup_hooks_here.ps1
```

> **Note**: Do not run `pre-commit install` here. The repo uses `core.hooksPath` and `pre-commit install` will refuse when it is set.

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Start backend service
python -m lifetrace.server
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd free-todo-frontend

# Install pnpm (if not already installed)
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Verify Setup

1. Backend should start searching for an available port from `8001` (default runs on `http://localhost:8001`)
2. Frontend should start searching for an available port from `3001` (default runs on `http://localhost:3001`)
3. Frontend automatically detects the running backend port by checking the `/health` endpoint
4. The actual ports used will be displayed in the console
5. Visit the API documentation address shown in the console (usually `http://localhost:8001/docs`) to view the API docs
6. Visit the frontend address shown in the console (usually `http://localhost:3001`) to view the frontend interface

> **Note**: If a port is occupied, both frontend and backend will automatically search for the next available port. The console will display the actual port used.

## 🌿 Git Flow Workflow

FreeTodo project adopts a standardized Git Flow branch management strategy to ensure code quality and standardized development processes.

### Branch Structure

We maintain the following branches:

- **`main`** - Production environment branch, contains the most stable code, directly deployable
- **`dev`** - Development environment branch for daily development and feature integration
- **`test`** - Testing environment branch for complete integration testing
- **`feat/*`** - Feature development branches, created from `dev`
- **`fix/*`** - Bug fix branches, created from `dev`, `test`, or `main`
- **`hotfix/*`** - Emergency fix branches, created from `main`

### Detailed Workflow

For complete documentation on Git Flow, including branch strategy, workflow, naming conventions, common scenarios, and best practices, please refer to:

📖 **[Git Flow Workflow Documentation](GIT_FLOW.md)**

This documentation includes:

- 🌳 Complete branch strategy explanation
- 🔄 Detailed workflows for various scenarios
- 📝 Branch naming conventions
- 🎯 Common development scenario examples
- 💡 Best practices and tips
- ❓ FAQ
- 🚦 Workflow diagrams
- 📚 Git command cheat sheet

### Quick Start

If you're already familiar with Git Flow, here's a quick reference:

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# 2. Develop and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
# Create PR to dev branch on GitHub
```

## 📝 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create Branch

Always create a new branch from the latest `main`:

```bash
# Update local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create new branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feat/xxx` - New features
- `fix/xxx` - Bug fixes
- `docs/xxx` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/xxx` - Code refactoring
- `test/xxx` - Test related
- `chore/xxx` - Build tools or auxiliary changes

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow project coding standards
- Write clear code comments
- Ensure code runs correctly
- Add or update relevant tests
- Update relevant documentation

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
# Add changed files
git add .

# Commit changes (follow commit message guidelines)
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Create Pull Request

1. Visit your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill out the PR template
4. Wait for review and feedback

## 📐 Coding Standards

### Backend Standards (Python)

For detailed backend guidelines, see: [**Backend Development Guidelines**](BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md)

**Key Points**:

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type annotations (Type Hints)
- Functions and classes need docstrings
- Use Ruff for linting and formatting
- Line length limit: 100 characters

**Quick Check**:

```bash
# Run linting
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-format code
uv run ruff format .
```

### Frontend Standards (TypeScript/React)

For detailed frontend guidelines, see: [**Frontend Development Guidelines**](FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md)

**Key Points**:

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow React Hooks best practices
- Use functional components
- Use ESLint for linting
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

**Quick Check**:

```bash
cd free-todo-frontend

# Run ESLint
pnpm lint

# Build test
pnpm build
```
