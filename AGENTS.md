# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `lifetrace/`: FastAPI backend (routers, services, repositories, storage, llm, jobs, util).
- `lifetrace/config/`: runtime configuration (`config.yaml` is generated from `default_config.yaml`).
- `lifetrace/data/`: runtime data (SQLite DB, vector DB, logs) — do not commit.
- `free-todo-frontend/`: Next.js + React frontend, Electron wrapper, and scripts.
- `.github/`: contribution docs, guidelines, and repository assets.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Backend (from repo root):
- `uv sync` — install Python deps into `.venv`.
- `python -m lifetrace.server` — start FastAPI server (auto-selects port from 8001).
- `uv run ruff check .` / `uv run ruff format .` — lint/format backend.

Frontend (from `free-todo-frontend/`):
- `pnpm install` — install frontend deps.
- `pnpm dev` — start Next.js dev server with auto-port detection.
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm format` / `pnpm check` — Biome lint/format/check.
- `pnpm type-check` — run TypeScript type checks.

Packaging:
- `pnpm electron:build` (or `electron:build-win|mac|linux`) — build Electron app.
- `pnpm tauri:dev` / `pnpm tauri:build` — Tauri dev/build flows.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python: PEP 8, type hints, docstrings; Ruff enforces 4-space indent and 100-char lines.
- TypeScript: Biome handles formatting/linting; keep components functional and hooks-safe.
- Naming: use Conventional Commits scopes like `backend`, `frontend`, `ui`, `config`.

## Testing Guidelines
- No dedicated test runner is configured yet. If you add tests, place Python tests under `tests/`
  and align with Ruff’s `tests/*.py` per-file ignores. For frontend, prefer a future `pnpm test`
  script; document any new runner in this file.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits:
  - Example: `feat(frontend): add calendar drag and drop`.
- PRs should include: a clear description, linked issues (e.g., `Closes #123`),
  testing notes, and screenshots for UI changes. Use the `.github` PR template when available.

## Parallel Worktrees (Required for Concurrent Tasks)
- When working on multiple tasks in parallel, always use `git worktree` so each task
  has its own working directory, tests, and commits.
- Do not hardcode absolute paths or project names. Derive paths from the git repo root.
- Default worktree base directory is a sibling to the repo root:
  `<repo-parent>/_worktrees/<repo-name>/<task-slug>`.
- Keep the main worktree clean; each task uses its own branch and worktree.
- Each task must create a brand-new branch (do not reuse old branches).
- Branch naming must follow: `<Type>/<user>/<short-task>` where:
  - `Type` is lowercase: feat/chore/fix/hotfix/refactor (or other standard types).
  - `user` is the current git username (from git config).
  - `short-task` is a short summary (max 3 words).
- If a task name is provided, create a worktree first, then make changes in that worktree.
- Helper script (cross-platform): `python scripts/new_worktree.py "<task-name>"`

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit `lifetrace/config/config.yaml` or `lifetrace/data/`.
- API keys and secrets should live in local configs or environment variables only.
