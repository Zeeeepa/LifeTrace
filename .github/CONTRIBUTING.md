## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Backend Development

- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Git

#### Frontend Development

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm package manager
- Git

### Clone Repository

```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LifeTrace.git
cd LifeTrace

# Add upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/FreeU-group/LifeTrace.git
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Start backend service
python -m lifetrace.server
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install pnpm (if not already installed)
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Verify Setup

1. Backend should run on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Frontend should run on `http://localhost:3000`
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for API documentation
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` for frontend interface

## 📝 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create Branch

Always create a new branch from the latest `main`:

```bash
# Update local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feature/xxx` - New features
- `fix/xxx` - Bug fixes
- `docs/xxx` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/xxx` - Code refactoring
- `test/xxx` - Test related
- `chore/xxx` - Build tools or auxiliary changes

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow project coding standards
- Write clear code comments
- Ensure code runs correctly
- Add or update relevant tests
- Update relevant documentation

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
# Add changed files
git add .

# Commit changes (follow commit message guidelines)
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Create Pull Request

1. Visit your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill out the PR template
4. Wait for review and feedback

## 📐 Coding Standards

### Backend Standards (Python)

For detailed backend guidelines, see: [**Backend Development Guidelines**](BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md)

**Key Points**:

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type annotations (Type Hints)
- Functions and classes need docstrings
- Use Ruff for linting and formatting
- Line length limit: 100 characters

**Quick Check**:

```bash
# Run linting
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-format code
uv run ruff format .
```

### Frontend Standards (TypeScript/React)

For detailed frontend guidelines, see: [**Frontend Development Guidelines**](FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md)

**Key Points**:

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow React Hooks best practices
- Use functional components
- Use ESLint for linting
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

**Quick Check**:

```bash
cd frontend

# Run ESLint
pnpm lint

# Build test
pnpm build
```
